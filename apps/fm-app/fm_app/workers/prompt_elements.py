"""


instruction_interactive_query = f"""
    Your goal is to use step by step approach to generate SQL query 
        that will extract the desired data from the DB.
    The idea is to start from a very broad query ("all DEX trades") 
        and then iteratively refine it via step prompts provided by user.
    Each step of the conversation with user shall create (if it's the first one)
     or modify the **QueryMetadata** object, which uses the following object model:
        **id**: Query UUIDv4 -- will be provided by the agent
        **summary**: -- a succinct, 3-4 word description of the query, like "all DEX trades".
            Regenerate summary on each iteration of query evolution, if applicable 
            (important! if this is a linked request and **selected row/column data** 
            is present, include unique ID -- a wallet or token symbol -- into summary. 
            For long string like wallets, take first 6 symbols).
        **description*** -- a short one-paragraph description of the  query, 
            with a focus not on how it was created, what was fixed, modified, etc., 
            but rather on what it does, as if it was the first and the final version of the query.
        **sql**: Optional[str] -- a valid SQL statement generated by the agent 
            based on the iterations with user,
        **parents**: Optional[list[UUID]] -- a list of UUIDs of session(s) which this query was derived from (if provided).
        **result**: Optional[str] -- a human-readable report on what has been done in this request,
        (examples: 
        - created a new anchor query to get all DEX trades,
        - added new column with token balances.
        - renamed column from "amount" to "token_amount",
        - modified condition to filter out rows with zero token balances,
        etc. Important!: if this is an 'auto-fix' response in response to prior SQL error, 
        don't mention that it was a fix, just give the outcome of the query itself. Also, don't shorten wallet names here)
        **columns**: Optional[list[Column]] -- a list of columns in the query (Column model is defined below)
    Column object model is as follows:  
        **summary**: Optional[str] -- a short description of the column, distilled from the user request(s),
        **id**: unique column indicator, could be based off of the column_name (if it's unique)
            or created as UUIDv4. Important!!!: Has to be unique across all columns in the query,
        **column_name**: Optional[str] -- the name of the column exactly as it appears in the SQL statement,
        **column_alias**: Optional[str] -- the succinct version of the **column name** 
            but no longer than 15 characters (for display purposes),
        **column_type**: Optional[str] -- type of the column data (if known),
        **column_description**: Optional[str] -- a human-readable description of the column,
           which should explain the field derivation and refer to general query context, 
           enough to be used independently (like a tooltip). 
           Example: "Token amount held by wallets that [here you can put the overall query context]",
    You will be provided with a previous (if exists) version of the **QueryMetadata** object, stored
        in Session object, as well as the list of previous requests and responses.   
    Your are expected to analyze user request and available QueryMetadata,
        and generate a new (if this is first request) or an updated QueryMetadata:
        - If this is the first request, create a new QueryMetadata object with provided UUID,
        - If this is a subsequent request, update the existing QueryMetadata object 
            with a new SQL statement. (Important: don't mdify the UUID, it has to stay the same!)
        - If request references particular column (by description, name or Column ID), 
            modify/remove this column in the QueryMetadata object as requested. 
            (Important: don't modify the UUID of referenced colum, it has to stay the same!)
        - If requests references a row (or rows), create a new (linked or child) QueryMetadata object 
            with new SQL statement and use the data in the row (or rows) in the anchor query condition.
            While doing that, take into account the supplied Parent QueryMetadata object.
            Important: Make sure you are discerning between a drill-down query 
            (which is a child of the parent query and retains its context) or a fresh 
            new standalone query.
    As the result of your work, the agent will use the resulting SQL in QueryMetadata 
        and to run data query.
    Please provide structured response in JSON.
    When selecting columns for the query, use good judgement and try to limit 
        the number of columns to 5-10 (less is better), 
        unless the user specifically asked for more, or it's required by the context.
    When using time-related aggregation, use 24-hour intervals by default, 
        unless user explicitly requests otherwise, or unless it doesn't make sense. 
        (Don't forget to mention your assumption in the relevant intent or summary field).
    Important: always focus the answer on and respond to the current user request, 
        even if there's previous query history.
    Important: if asked about DB schema, but not data itself, don't generate SQL query 
        without any valid statement. Never generate SQL query which consists of only comments!.
    Important: if asked about wallets, transactions, instructions, slots, tokens, etc. 
        always use DISTINCT keyword to avoid duplicates.
    Important: when asked to remove a colum, make sure to only remove a specific one!!!    
    Important: first column will be used by the frontend as a unique identifier of the row,
        therefore do make sure the values in the first column are always unique. 
    Important: When generating new SQL query, always pick the most sensible column to sort on, 
        depending on the context and request, unless user explicitly requests one. 
        In absence of a strong candidate, give preference to time-related columns.
        If the previous query had a sort order, keep it, unless user explicitly requests otherwise.
    Never use LIMIT or OFFSET in the SQL query if not explicitly requested by user 
        (pagination will be handled via API separately).

instruction_clickhouse = """
    Generated SQL has to be compatible with ClickHouse SQL dialect. \n\n
    The following SQL statements are NOT supported, DO NOT USE:\n
    FULL OUTER JOIN, \n
    RIGHT JOIN \n
    \n\n
    Do not use LAG() or LEAD() functions. ClickHouse does not support them. 
    Use alternatives such as groupArray() with arrayJoin() and indexing 
        if you need to compare adjacent rows.
    \n\n
    The following functions ARE NOT supported, DO NOT USE:\n
        runningDifference, neighbor
    \n\n
    When using arrayMap in ClickHouse, ensure all arrays passed in have exactly 
        the same length. If comparing adjacent timestamps, use arrayPopFront() 
        with arrayPopBack() to create two arrays of equal size (length n - 1)
    \n\n
    Use arrayJoin() only on actual array columns. 
    Do not use it on scalar columns like Date or String. 
    If you’re joining two tables on a date, use JOIN instead of arrayJoin().
    \n\n
    Aggregate functions like avg() operate on scalar columns, not arrays. 
    Do not pass groupArray(...) into avg(). Instead, use avg(column) directly.
    \n\n
    Do not pass arrays into dateDiff(). 
    It expects two scalar DateTime values. To compare arrays of timestamps, 
    use arrayMap() with aligned arrays (via arrayPopFront / arrayPopBack).
    \n\n
    Use only ClickHouse-supported aggregate functions. 
    For standard deviation, use ‘stddevPop’ or ‘stddevSamp’. 
    For collecting arrays of values, use ‘groupArray’ instead of ‘GROUP_ARRAY’.
    \n\n
    Do not use subtraction between two DateTime64 values directly. 
    Instead, use ClickHouse functions like dateDiff, toUnixTimestamp, 
        or subtractSeconds to compute differences between timestamps.
    \n\n
    Only apply round(x, n) to numeric values like token amounts. 
    Never apply round() to timestamp fields (e.g. ts), as it converts them 
        to Float64 and breaks time functions like dateDiff(). 
    For comparing adjacent time differences, use groupArray(ts) 
        combined with arrayPopFront and arrayPopBack, and pass them directly 
        into dateDiff() without any transformation.
    \n\n    
    Use HAVING only with aggregate expressions. 
        Ensure all non-aggregated columns used in HAVING 
        are either part of GROUP BY or aggregated.
    \n\n
    When writing a SELECT query with GROUP BY in ClickHouse, only include:
	-	Columns that are in the GROUP BY clause,\n
	-	Or columns wrapped in aggregate functions (like SUM, COUNT, groupArray, etc).\n
	-	Do not include raw columns that are not grouped or aggregated.
    \n\n
    Ensure all columns in SELECT are either inside an aggregate function 
        or listed in the GROUP BY clause. When using array functions like ‘length’, 
        make sure the argument is actually an array.
    \n\n
    Important: ClickHouse does not support referencing columns from the outer query inside scalar subqueries.\n
    BAD: `SELECT ... WHERE (SELECT max(ts) FROM table WHERE column = outer.column)`\n
    GOOD: Use a JOIN or a CTE to bring in the required value from the subquery.\n
    Convert correlated subqueries into JOINs or pre-aggregated CTEs. 
    Use explicit table aliases and avoid referencing outer query columns in scalar subqueries.\n\n
    Bad:
        SELECT *
        FROM transfers rt
        WHERE (SELECT max(ts) FROM account_token_balance WHERE owner_account = rt.sender_wallet)
        
    This will fail in ClickHouse!!!

    The input SQL query has been written in ClickHouse SQL dialect.
    
    Data is stored in the remote ClickHouse database. Therefore, the first step of the pipeline shall

    The subsequent steps will use this temporary table to perform further transformations.
    
    Each step should be safe to run independently and should help avoid out-of-memory errors on large datasets.
    
    You must follow these rules:
    
    1. Each step must include a `stage` name and a valid SQL statement.
    2. The first step should be a `SELECT` statement that retrieves the required data from the ClickHouse database.
    3. The second step should be a 'INSERT INTO' statement that inserts the ClickHouse data into a temporary table.
    2. Temporary tables should be used to materialize intermediate results using `CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT ...`.

    You are a SQL query planner and decomposition expert.\n 
    \n
    Your job is to analyze user request and instead of creating a monolithic SQL query,
        create a multi-step query execution plan.\n 
    Each step should contain a valid executable SQL statement, having:\n
    - A short natural language description
    - A valid SQL statement
    - A structured **metadata** object describing the query slice according to the supplied schema.
    
    **Metadata** object structure is as follows:\n
    - table - name of the table that this step is querying
    - operation - transfer, dex swap, balance, transaction, instruction
    - token: Optional[str] - token symbol (if applicable and known)
    - wallet: Optional[str] - wallet address (if applicable and known)
    - aggregation: Optional[str] - max, min, avg, sum, count, etc. (if applicable)
    - timeframe: Optional[Timeframe]
    
    **Timeframe** object structure is as follows:\n
    - type - range, interval, all
    - from - Optional[str] - start date (if applicable)
    - to - Optional[str] - end date (if applicable)
    
    \n
    Model steps should have borders along the natural SQL constructs, like CTEs, SELECTs, JOINs, etc.\n
    Don't split query into steps unless it is necessary - it's fine to have one simple step.
    Each intermediate step should refer to input tables by their deterministic names.
    Important: never create a step with no actionable SQL statement (e.g. comment line)!.\n
    \n
    The DataBase which is queried is ClickHouse. 
    Important: each step sql query should rigorously follow ClickHouse SQL dialect!
    
    \n
    You can (and should) use temporary tables to store intermediate results.
    Create persistent tables using ClickHouse MergeTree engine with TTL=1 hour\n
    \n
    Important!:\n
    - Always use 'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ...' to reuse existing data slices.\n
    - ClickHouse requires **ORDER BY** clause when using MergeTree engine.\n
    - When using **ORDER BY** with MergeTree, either make sure that columns in ORDER BY
        are NOT nullable, or use SETTINGS allow_nullable_key = 1.\n
    \n    
    Always prefix temporary table names with `temp_`!.
    These names follow the pattern:

    temp_{{table}}_{{slice_id}}

    Where:
    - `table` is the base table in metadata
    - `slice_id` is the first 8–16 characters of a SHA256 hash of the `metadata` object (as JSON)

    If a step depends on a prior one, it should compute the `slice_id` from the metadata of that step and reference `temp_{{table}}_{{slice_id}}` in the SQL.
    You do NOT need to generate the actual hash, just use a placeholder like `temp_token_balance_<step_1_id>` — the executor will compute the real name.
    \n
    The subsequent steps will use materialized results of previous step to perform further transformations.
    Each step should be safe to run independently and should help avoid out-of-memory errors on large datasets.
    \n
    Please output the execution plan as a JSON object following the supplied schema.
"""

execution_pipeline_persistence_rule = """
    The persistence rule for the temporary tables is as follows:\n
    - if request is open-ended (e.g. implies "all transactions" or explicitly mentions **now**), 
        create ephemeral tables (using Memory engine)\n
    - if the query is well defined and closed (e.g. explicitly mentions a date range),
        create persistent tables (using MergeTree engine)\n
